abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry hard, decimating staffing, income, and profit. In May and June of 2021, in an attempt to stimulate the sector, a random selection of Toronto restaurants were re-opened during the pandemic. Although there were significant increases in the number of employees and profit, the helpfulness of the temporary re-opening had mixed reviews. Due to this uncertainty, it is necessary to have further conversations with restaurant owners to understand the deeper affects of COVID-19 and how to mitigate further hardships and consequences. \newpage

# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has induced global action and, in some instances, inaction, that has affected millions of people. With over 100 million confirmed cases and 2.4 million total deaths, the pandemic has caused suffering and distress for countless people [@bbc]. In other instances, it has brought immense fortune - Jeff Bezos’s wealth increased \$92 billion between March and August of 2020 [@oxfam]. It is estimated that he could give all his 876,000 employees a $105,000 bonus and still be as wealthy as he was before the outbreak of COVID-19 [@oxfam]. Unfortunately, this has been a fantasy for the majority of global citizens - and Canada is no exception. 

&nbsp; 

At the beginning of the pandemic, nearly a sixth of all Canadians applied for emergency benefits [@harris]. This has had enormous effects on the population’s mental health with 48% rating their mental health as eight or higher on a ten point scale in 2020 compared to 73% in 2018 [@statcan]. Concurrently, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused disruptions in numerous industries, but with some of the most detrimental ones occurring in the consumer-facing service sector [@statcan]. Before the pandemic, the restaurant industry generated one out of every fifteen jobs, paying Canadians nearly \$30 billion in wages and benefits [@ourrest]. It also contributed $31 billion to Canada’s GDP annually, proving its economic value [@ourrest]. Unfortunately, the epidemic has generated massive unemployment and many restaurants have been shut down and will never reopen [@larue]. 

&nbsp;

In an effort to avoid further devastation to the restaurant community, Petit Poll has collaborated with the Ontario Government to examine the effects of COVID-19 on restaurants in Toronto and understand what provisions can be made. Using Dinesafe [@Dinesafe] data from the City of Toronto as a parameter for simulated data, this paper will first explore the effects of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry from 2019-2020 using Dinesafe data from the City of Toronto. We will then continue to investigate specific findings from the survey by comparing data from the control and treatment groups. We will finally end on a discussion about the greater implications of our study, limitations and possible expansions.

## Description of Study 

At the time of this study, it was assumed that all restaurants in the GTA were closed due to COVID-19. However, restaurants could continue to prepare food for curb-side pickup and delivery so their businesses could generate some income. This study looks at the effects of the lockdown on the restaurant industry and inspects the benefits of re-opening a business for a short amount of time during the pandemic. Keeping the restaurant business afloat in Toronto will be a monumental and expensive task. If risk can be mitigated, it could be justifiable to allow some restaurants to (temporarily) re-open. If so, they could generate enough income to survive the pandemic. Otherwise, the government could be looking at subsidies for each business – and with the sheer number of foodservice establishments in the GTA, this could add up quickly. 

&nbsp;

There are many foodservice establishments in Toronto, and it would be ideal to re-open everything. However, this is not a realistic option. Due to the nature of how COVID-19 spreads, it is still crucial that we limit the number of interactions people have with one another during the day. Therefore, we had to take a subsample from the larger foodservice establishment population. Since “dine-in” restaurants have had minimal opportunity to generate revenue during the pandemic, they were selected as the frame for this study. Foodservice establishments listed as “restaurant” in the City of Toronto’s Dinesafe dataset [@Dinesafe] were considered.
 
&nbsp;
 
The eligible businesses were then contacted by the Ontario Government via email or phone and were asked if they would like to participate in a trial re-opening. If they answered yes, they were added to a list. If they decided against the re-opening, or did not respond, they were not included in the study. After contacting the different businesses, the “yes” list was randomly subsampled into 2 groups, with a 50:50 chance to be placed in each group. The first group had the opportunity to re-open their business for a period of 2 months: May – June 2021. The other group was asked to remain closed to act as a control group. Participants who could re-open their business were issued a certification sticker that must have been visible from the street. At the end of the two months, a survey was released to the participants to gain information about their business, how it had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and how much re-opening helped. 

&nbsp;

To entice the control group to complete the survey at the end of June, we initially discussed providing financial compensation. However, with over 7,000 eager-to-open restaurants in the GTA [@Dinesafe] this number would quickly escalate to an unrealistic proportion. Therefore, the Ontario Government has allowed the control group to re-open their business for two months as well – if they completed the survey (as compensation for participating). Those in the control group who completed the survey could open for the months of July and August (2021), but would no longer be part of the study. For more information on the survey (including a detailed description and screenshots of the questions), see the Appendix. Because of the way this study has been structured, the cost remained relatively low – just a payment to Petit Poll for their work. 

&nbsp;

After completion of the study, Petit Poll analyzed the survey responses and presented them to the Ontario Government. Those restaurants who responded to the survey were considered part of the sample. Ultimately, the government must make the final decision if it is worth the risk to re-open businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies may be needed to decide how many businesses should be allowed to open, and for how long.

## Dataset

This dataset was pulled from the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal – Dinesafe [@Dinesafe]. The Open Data Portal is a regularly updated and open-sourced data delivery tool which allows users to “generate insights, analyses, and/or…develop web/mobile applications” (@CityOfToronto1, @CityOfToronto2). The dataset was analyzed using `R` [@R]. Various packages were used to analyze the data. First, `opendatatoronto` [@opendatatoronto] and `sf` (@sf) were used to get the dataset from the open data portal. Next, the `here` package [@here] was used for easily saving and locating files. The `tidyverse` package [@tidyverse] was used for general analysis of the dataset. `Ggplot2` [@ggplot2], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra], and `gridExtra` (@gridExtra) were used to create plots, tables, and figures. `Float` (@float) was used to lock tables in place. `Ggmap` (@ggmap) and `mapview` (@mapview) were used to create a map of the GTA and its respective restaurants. The `generator` package [@generator] was used to help simulate data. The `stringi` [@stringi] package was used to process strings in the dataset. The `janitor` package [@janitor] was used to clean the dataset. `TinyTex` [@tinytex] was used to help write the output to PDF. Finally, `bookdown` [@bookdown] was used to build the pdf and `bibtex` [@bibtex] was used to create references. 

&nbsp; 

The Dinesafe dataset was published by Toronto Public Health. Its main purpose is to record the number of inspections, infractions, and legal histories of different foodservice businesses in the GTA. In addition, it also holds basic information on all registered Torono foodservice establishments. After conducting an inspection of a respective foodservice location, a record of what was done or found is created and eventually transferred to a CSV file. Unregistered restaurants are not included in the dataset. 

&nbsp;

For the purposes of this study, we kept information about the business’ name, location, and type. Location included street address, latitude, and longitude. Information about inspections was removed from the dataset, as it fell outside the scope of this analysis. There were many variables from the survey that were added to the dataset. First, the restaurant ID was added, starting at 1 and increasing incrementally. The rest of the variables were randomly generating in `R` [@R]. Those variables were: Phone number 1, phone number 2, email, website, number of years in operation, franchise (y/n), own or lease, number of employees before the first lockdown, number of employees at the end of the first lockdown, number of employees during re-opening, the total number of weekly hours the restaurant was open before the lockdown, weekly hours during the lockdown, weekly hours during the temporary re-opening, delivery (y/n), curbside pickup (y/n), dine-in service (y/n), patio service (y/n), type of cuisine, serves alcohol (y/n), target pricepoint (low, average, high), income and profit for the months of May and June in 2019, 2020, 2021 (each with their own column), was the restaurant selected to re-open (y/n), and finally, helpfulness of the re-opening on a scale of 1 to 5. 

&nbsp; 


This dataset has strengths and weaknesses. For positives, this dataset is from a reputable source. It should contain all registered restaurants in the GTA. Nothing should be left out, unless the business is running unconventionally. Additionally, we have real restaurant names and locations to study, although locations were not a main source of interest in this study. In terms of weaknesses, Dinesafe did not specify how they classified different establishments. It is unknown what the differences are between different classes of establishments. For example, what is the specific difference between a "restaurant" and a "cafeteria"? Depending on how (or who) classified the different establishments, it is possible for bias to arise here. There is the possibility that an establishment that should be classified as one thing was classified as another. Another weakness of this dataset was that much of the information was simulated. With so many variables, the potential for error increased. Also, many assumptions were made about different probabilities. It is important to recognize that this study is merely a model developed on randomized data. It has potential to be used in the future on real data. 


## When Covid Strikes

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
all_pop_resturants = read.csv('../../dataset/all_resturants.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

A total of 7,221 surveys were collected and analyzed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry and the potential benefits of reopening for 2 months. Of the businesses that participated in the survey, income substantially decreased for all restaurants in a two month period between 2019 and 2020 by more than 75% (Table \@ref(tab:2020dec)). 

```{r 2020dec, fig.cap="Average income and profit for all restaurants in the survey over a two month period between May and June", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Average of income, profit and staff
ave_Income2019 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Income_052019_062019))
ave_Income2020 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Income_052020_062020))
ave_Profit2019 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Profit_052019_062019))
ave_Profit2020 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Profit_052020_062020))
ave_Staff2019 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Number_Of_Staff_Before_Covid))
ave_Staff2020 <- round(mean(all_pop_resturants$Number_Of_Staff_During_Covid))

average_table <- data.frame("ave_Income2019" = ave_Income2019, 
                            "ave_Income2020" = ave_Income2020,
                            "ave_Profit2019" = ave_Profit2019, 
                            "ave_Profit2020" = ave_Profit2020)


kbl(average_table, booktabs = T, col.names = c("Income 2019 ($)", "Income 2020 ($)", 
                                               "Profit 2019 ($)" , "Profit 2020 ($)"),

  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>% #lock table in place
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```

Table \@ref(tab:2020dec) shows the devastating effects of the lockdown on the restaurant industry. For restaurants whose income was less than the mean, these types of losses could quickly result in closure if intervention of subsidies are not put in place. Figure 1 further represents this income reduction.

               top = "Comparing Income and Profit Between years 2019 and 2020
               ")
```


&nbsp;

Figure \@ref(fig:incproffig) shows that businesses in the months of May and June 2019 (red) saw a distributed income from \$100,000 to \$800,000. In 2020 (blue), these numbers were drastically different. Nearly all restaurants earned less than \$200,000, with most clustering between \$0 and \$100,000. The profit graph shows the same trend. In May and June 2019, restaurants were profiting somewhere between \$5,000 and \$30,000. However, in the same months of 2020, they were profiting close to or less than \$1000 and very few earning more than \$5000. It is evident that the restaurant industry was substantially impacted by COVID-19. 

&nbsp; 

In addition, restaurants saw a drastic change in the number of working employees. Table \@ref(tab:staff) shows the dramatic decrease in the number of staff employed. 

&nbsp; 

```{r staff, fig.cap="Average number of staff between May and June of 2019 and 2020", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

average_staff <- data.frame("ave_Staff2019" = round(ave_Staff2019), 
                            "ave_Staff2020" = round(ave_Staff2020))

kbl(average_staff, booktabs = T, col.names = c("Number of Staff 2019", "Number of Staff 2020"), align = c("l", "l"), caption = "Average number of staff between May and June of 2019 and 2020") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```

&nbsp; 

Table \@ref(tab:staff) shows a decrease in staff of more than 70%. These losses indicate mass unemployment in the restaurant industry and the far reaching implications of COVID-19, which will be discussed in depth in Section 3. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of the change in staffing. 

&nbsp; 

```{r stafffig, fig.cap="Graph of average number of staff between May and June of 2019 and 2020", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Staff for all population graph

all_pop_plot_Staff <- data.frame(Staff_05_062019 = all_pop_resturants$Number_Of_Staff_Before_Covid, 
                                 Staff_05_062020 = all_pop_resturants$Number_Of_Staff_During_Covid)
all_pop_plot_Staff <- gather(all_pop_plot_Staff)


ggplot(all_pop_plot_Staff, aes(x = value, fill = key)) +
  geom_density(kernel = "gaussian", alpha = 0.2) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Surveyed Resturants' Staff"))+ 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10), 
        legend.position = c(0.82, 0.9))+
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("# of Staff May-June 2019", "# of Staff May-June 2020")) +
  labs(x = "Number of Employees", 
       y = "Density of Restaurants",
       title = "Comparing Number of Employees Between 2019 and 2020")

```

&nbsp; 

Figure 2 reveals that in May and June of 2020, nearly all restaurants employed fewer than 20 staff. This is compared to 2019 where there is a greater number of staff employed, with some restaurants employing over 60 people. Not only did COVID-19 affect restaurants' income and profit, it also affected the livelihoods of people who worked in the foodservice industry. 

&nbsp;

To understand the demographics of the surveyed businesses, we pulled information on their type of operation, years of operation, and property ownership. Table \@ref(tab:demfran) compares the number of franchised and non-franchised restaurants in the GTA. Table \@ref(tab:demyears) shows the number of years the business has been operational. Lastly, Table \@ref(tab:demown) shows the number of restaurants that own their property vs lease it. 

&nbsp;

```{r demfran, fig.cap="Number of Restaurants Franchised", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Franchise

tabyl(all_pop_resturants$Franchise, sort = TRUE) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c("Franchise (Y/N)", "Number of Restaurants", "Percent of Restaurants"), align = c("l", "l", "l"), caption = "Number of restaurants franchised") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

#Even split - 59% Non franchise vs. 41% franchise

```


```{r demyears, fig.cap="Number of Years in Operation", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Business operation year freq table

tabyl(all_pop_resturants$Business_Operation_Year, sort = TRUE) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c("Years in Business", "Number of Restaurants", "Percent of Restaurants"), align = c("l", "l", "l"), caption = "Number of years in operation") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```


```{r demown, fig.cap="Number of Restaurants Who Own the Property", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Own / Lease

tabyl(all_pop_resturants$Own_Lease, sort = TRUE) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c("Restaurant Ownership", "Number of Restaurants", "Percent of Restaurants"), align = c("l", "l", "l"), caption = "Number of restaurants who own the property") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```

It is apparent that the majority of businesses were non-franchised, and were operational for less than five years (Table \@ref(tab:demfran), Table \@ref(tab:demyears)). Furthermore, the majority of properties were leased, creating additional costs that are difficult to maintain with a decrease in income (Table \@ref(tab:demown)). Finally, Table \@ref(tab:demprice) inspects the distribution of restaurants at different price-points. Restaurants were asked to self report their targeted demographic (low-end, average, high-end).

&nbsp;

```{r demprice, fig.cap="Price-Point of Restaurants", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Pricepoint

tabyl(all_pop_resturants$Price_Point_Target, sort = TRUE) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c("Price-Point", "Number of Restaurants", "Percent of Restaurants"), align = c("l", "l", "l"), caption = "Price-point of restaurants") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```

Of the businesses that completed the survey, 40.2% of restaurants were classified as low-end, 39.7% were classified as average, and 20.1% were classified as high-end (Table \@ref(tab:demprice)). These restaurants were categorized accordingly to have an accurate comparison between the control and sample groups during the temporary re-opening. The sample group were the restaurants which reopened and the control group were the ones which remained closed. Included in the next 3 sections are comparisons of profit generated and staff employed during the temporary re-opening. Income is not included as this study looks to determine if the two month period where the restaurant was allowed to open generated enough profit to allow the restaurant to survive the pandemic.

Restaurants in the treatment group earned roughly 188% more than the control (Figure \@ref(fig:lowprofit)), proving that re-opening was extremely beneficial. Employment had an even more significant trend, showed in Figure \@ref(fig:lowstaff).

             ")

```


Employment showed an almost 247% increase in staff (Figure \@ref(fig:lowstaff)). Employment was almost back to 2019 levels when restaurant re-opened. However, in the end, treated restaurants were torn on the helpfulness scale, shown in Table \@ref(tab:lowscore).  

```{r lowscore, fig.cap="Helpfulness score of low-end restaurants based on a 5-point scale", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Helpfulness of low end

tabyl(sample_low_end_rest$Helpfulness, sort = TRUE) %>%

  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c("Helpfulness on 5-Point Scale", "Number of Restaurants", "Percent of Restaurants"), align = c("l", "l", "l"), caption = "Low-end restaurants responses to helpfulness on a 5-point scale") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```
Table \@ref(tab:lowscore) shows an average response of 3.36. Although 34.1% of respondents scored a five, 19.7% still scored a one. This could be due to the effort that it takes to prepare a restaurant to open for a two month period, especially in the wake of COVID-19. The amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), training and sanitizing equipment needed could outweigh the benefits of opening.


## Middle-End Restaurants

Middle-end restaurants experienced fairly similar profit outcomes compared to low-end restaurants, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:midprofit).

Restaurants in the treatment group saw a 179% increase in profit in contrast to the control group (Figure \@ref(fig:midprofit)). This was very similar to the low-end group. Employment trends are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:midstaff).

             ")

```


For restaurants in the mid-range of price-point, employment experienced a 254% increase in staff, which are similar numbers compared to low-end restaurants. Again, staffing levels were almost back to 2019 levels. Table \@ref(tab:midscore) shows reported helpfulness scores.  

```{r midscore, fig.cap="Helpfulness score of middle-end restaurants based on a 5-point scale", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale-down"))

```
With the improvement in profit and staffing, 36% of the restaurants categorized helpfulness as a five on a five point scale (Table \@ref(tab:midscore)). Although an additional 17.9% of restaurants scored a four, there were still  20.5% that scored a one.



## High-End Restaurants

Finally, high-end restaurants experienced the smallest improvement in earnings, although by a fraction of a difference. Results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:highprofit).

             ")

```


The treatment group earned 178% more than the control group between May and June. The nature of high-end restaurants offering primarily dine-in service would assume that they would see the greatest positive effects of the reopening, yet they did not see as substantial of an increase as other price brackets. This could be due to lingering hesitance surrounding COVID-19, or the number of people who experienced financial losses at this time. This increase in profit could also be a factor in the increase in staffing - see Figure \@ref(fig:highstaff).

High-end restaurants saw a 251% increase in staff. Additionally, high-end restaurants saw a similar number of positive responses to the reopening as middle-end restaurants - shown in Table \@ref(tab:highscore).

In total, 36.8% of high-end restaurants scored a five and over 19.6% scored a one.


# Discussion 

COVID-19 had affected industries in the most unexpected ways, partially because the rampant nature of COVID-19 was unforeseen but also because policies and procedures were underdeveloped. It is clear through literature reviews and this study, that the restaurant industry is a sector that suffered the most losses. Through the surveys, it was apparent that profit losses between 2019 and 2020 were enough to put some restaurants out of business. This study was executed in an effort to rebuild the service economy and encourage restaurant revival. Although numerically the study seemed successful, the helpfulness section indicated mixed reviews. It is important to follow up with restaurants to gain a deeper understanding into what worked and what failed. Despite this lack of complete understanding, there are a few areas that can be discussed including the impact on restaurants, unemployment of restaurant staff and broader implications of the study. Additionally, we will discuss the weaknesses of the study and how the study could be expanded in the future.

## Restaurant Hardships

Restaurant responses to the survey made it extremely obvious that the restaurant industry suffered an enormous amount due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Businesses earned on average less than half of what they earned in the previous year according to our study. As restaurants contribute billions of dollars to the economy each year, this loss was observed by the entire Canadian public. Although lockdown measures prevented many citizens from dining out, and therefore, enabled monetary savings, the restaurant industry endured, and continues to endure hardships that forced almost 83% of businesses in the accommodation and foodservice industry to temporarily close [@wu]. According to another study by Statistics Canada and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce [@wu], 60% of restaurants would permanently close within three months. Restaurants already earn considerably less than other industries with profit margins that sit between 2.8% and 6.1% on average [@forbes2]. These already unstable practices became detrimental to restaurants when the epidemic arose.

There are many factors that can be attributed to these massive losses that go beyond the effects of social distancing measures. For businesses that own the property of the restaurant, mortgages still had to be made. Although the Government of Canada created a mortgage payment deferral program, they still required individuals to resume payments after an allotted time, and repay the mortgage payment that was deferred [@govcan]. This type of payment plan is not feasible for restaurants and many were forced out of business. In addition, few provisions were put in place for businesses that leased their space. The Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA), launched by the Ontario government, provided loans to landlords that covered 50% of commercial rent and required tenets to cover 25% of rent [@ontgov]. Unfortunately, CECRA only lasted from April to June of 2020, which was inadequate considering the impacts of the epidemic still exist in 2021. 

## Individual Impact

The COVID-19 epidemic forced massive unemployment due to permanent closure or cuts to scale. It is estimated that 67% of businesses had to lay off staff [@wu], contributing to 800,000 individuals experiencing unemployment [@larue]. Unfortunately, workers in the service sector tend to already be in vulnerable positions, further exasperating economic disparities. In addition, workers under the age of 25 are twice as likely to work in a sector of the economy that has been shut down [@blundell]. This localized situation creates further strain for individuals who suffered unemployment. Similarly to restaurant owners, many individuals in these positions do not own property and therefore continue to pay rent. Unfortunately, the government provided even fewer services that would alleviate rent. The City of Toronto states on their website, “all property owners are strongly urged to find ways to help tenants to stay in their homes. The City encourages landlords and tenants to proactively communicate about their situations and establish fair arrangements” [@cityto]. The lack of resources forces tenants and landlords to make personal arrangements, which may never occur thus placing individuals in situations of potential homelessness and extreme strain.

Not only does the closure of restaurants impact those that were laid off, but it also impacts individuals who depend on low-end restaurants. Many communities rely on the “convenience, reliability and affordability” of fast food restaurants especially as panic buying led to a shortage of cheap food staples that many families depend on [@myers]. Families who depended on free lunch programs provided by schools for their children further experienced food insecurity [@myers]. Although restaurants still offer curb-side pickup, restaurant closures could continue to limit people’s access to food, especially for those in marginalized communities.

## Study Implications

While it is important to discuss the far reaching consequences of COVID-19, it is also necessary to acknowledge the implications of a study such as this. Although this study could find a temporary solution to mitigate some impacts of the pandemic, it is imperative to recognize that we are examining the businesses and lives of real individuals. Individuals who have been enduring difficult circumstances due to the pandemic and subsequent lack of necessary resources. We must critically analyse the ethical implications of conducting studies on individuals with tangible consequences and work with these businesses and individuals to understand the best course of action. This study aimed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on businesses, and although we do have a section to investigate how helpful the study was, it is not nearly enough to fully comprehend the ways in which businesses need assistance. Further conversations should be performed to accomplish this task. These discussions will provide better insights into how the Government of Canada can relieve and improve current situations.

## Weaknesses

Part of the data about restaurants have been simulated and randomized, thus it does not capture real situations nor does it capture existing problems and biases. It may not be viable for a restaurant to afford the expenses of running a restaurant in those couple of months and could go bankrupt. Especially as COVID-19 guidelines require businesses to purchase the necessary PPE and sanitary equipment. Due to the simulated data and assumptions about decrease in profits, high demand could in fact generate a decent income not anticipated by the experiment. Although this is a beneficial outcome, we must recognize some of these stories that we might have missed.

The experiment's focus is on the financial gain and keeping the foodservice industry afloat. It does not look at how keeping the open restaurants will affect people’s compliance with social distancing and quarantine during a mandated lockdown. The study contradicts lockdown stay-at-home guidelines and isolating unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, it does not take into consideration how dining at the restaurants might affect the transmission of the virus. It is beyond the experiment’s scope, but it is an important aspect the Government of Canada must regard. Afterall, virus containment and elimination is extremely important in order to resume normalcy and revive the economy. This study would pose useful though for when the government is transitioning to gradual opening of restaurants when the majority have been vaccinated and the active infected cases are low.

## Future Directions

The study could benefit from adding an analysis of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) neighborhoods into consideration. A clustering analysis could organize the randomization for the control and treatment groups on a neighborhood level, and that would help understand the challenges each neighborhood faces and thus design different solutions based on their needs. The diversity of the GTA signifies a similar variety of circumstances that should be considered when defining solutions for the restaurant industry.

In addition, the trial could be repeated by using different parameters such as the duration the restaurants should stay open, or a rotational reopening of restaurants. It is unknown as to whether two month rotations are substantial enough to see improvements. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how demand changes by season. Winter includes many holidays and attracts consumer behaviour, but it may lead to less outdoor foot traffic. Comparatively, summer allows for more foot traffic, yet there may be higher employment rates as students look for jobs thus less leisurely time available. The seasonality of the foodservice industry also creates demand for certain foods at different times of the year. For example, demand for ice cream usually increases in the summer and decreases in the winter. If using a rotational model, it would be unfair for some restaurants to benefit from popular months, while others do not receive the same benefits. We would need to create a model that promotes fairness on all levels of the experiment.

Finally, another direction that could be captured is the definition of a restaurant. Although we used Dinesafe’s data, it was not concrete on how each restaurant differs and the distinct challenges that each may face. For this study, we excluded restaurants that were categorized as private cafeterias, such as educational facilities and care homes. These foodservice industries are still components of the food industry that need to be discussed, especially in relation to COVID-19 where they are still potential areas of transmission. Additionally, they are businesses that have also suffered increased losses during this time and no business should be excluded from study.


# Conclusion 
COVID-19 caused significant turmoil in the Canadian economy - especially in the restaurant industry. In the City of Toronto, restaurants saw a dramatic decrease in income, profit, and the number of staff employed. The Ontario government allowed a random selection of restaurants to reopen, in an attempt to stimulate the industry. Comparing those restaurants who opened to those who were asked to stay closed, there was a significant increase in profit and staffing. Profit did not reach 2019 levels, but still increased by roughly 180%. Staffing returned to near-2019 levels. Even with the increases seen in profit and staffing, helpfulness scores had mixed reviews. Regardless of the restaurant price-point, a significant portion of the sample responded that the process was not helpful whatsoever. Perhaps the stresses of re-opening during a pandemic outweighed the benefits. If this is the case, restaurant owners may choose to remain closed if the government gives them the option to re-open again during the pandemic. 

If the Ontario Government wishes to pursue this avenue to stimulate the sector, they will need to do more testing to determine the number of restaurants to open, and for how long. Perhaps limiting competition and increasing the amount of time open would boost profit even more, shifting the average helpfulness rating higher. This study could be expanded upon in a number of ways, but it should remain a priority to understand the effects of COVID-19 and mitigation measures in a comprehensive manner. Additionally, it is important to remember that real people and real businesses are suffering the consequences of COVID-19. Extensive conversations should be conducted to understand what intervention and resources would be the most beneficial for all business.

We found a foundational dataset to start our restaurant research from Toronto Open Data Catalogue. The <DineSafe> Dataset is an XML file that contains the name, health inspection data and coordinates of GTA resturaants. However, there is no detailed description on the website regarding the data overview. We attempted to retrieve the dataset and convert the XML to csv in R. However, after many attempts, we found out that the xml parsing did not work directly in RStudio due to most likely the formatting and length the XML file. Through looking at potential solutions on StackOverflow and and troubleshoot the error message with websites in the same nature, we did not discover any working reproducible way to convert the XML file to CSV file. The closest answer that matches our speculation is on stackover by "ChallengeAccepted": "After the 20th page the loop was still running with no urls and hence it started calling read_html with NAs for the other loop iterations.". (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40230810/webscraping-in-r-does-not-exist-in-current-working-directory-error) Therefore a secondary approach was taken, the XML file was downloaded from the Toronto Open Data Catalogue and converted through an online converter: https://onlinexmltools.com/convert-xml-to-csv. The final result contains the basic information that we need to set up our survey simulation data - restaurant counts, names and coordinates. As expected, the inspection part seems to be the issue that blocks R from properly parsing all the data. The inspection data in CSV ends up showing up as "Object". After the online conversion, the The converted CSV file was downloaded into dataset/dinesafeCSV.csv. Original XML file was also saved in the location dataset/dine_safe_original.xml.



## Survey Description

The survey was released to those businesses who answered “Yes” upon the initial contact from the government. Those who answered the survey were part of the sample for this study. The survey was produced by Petit Poll, a company employed by the Ontario Government, and a link can be found [__here__](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeafb8VzHCH_0ZQVKnfg46_E6WHMVqnADwMcg7nOqaibhFweg/viewform?usp=sf_link). The survey contained sections about contact information, background and workforce, and performance. The survey looked to generate data about 3 distinct time periods: pre-pandemic, lockdown, and during re-opening. 

&nbsp;

The first section of the survey is used to gain contact information for the business. Name, address, phone numbers, etc. The second section focuses on background and workforce. This is where we begin to ask about the effects of COVID-19 and re-opening. In this section, we ask about restaurant background, as well as how their number of hours and number of employees has changed due to the pandemic. In the final section, we ask questions about income and profit. We also ask, on a 5-point scale, how helpful it was in the eyes of the business owner to open for a few months. 

&nbsp;

As with any survey, there is the possibility of non-responses. If the non-response comes from the control group, then they are not eligible for compensation, which is the opportunity to re-open their business. We believe this to be a strong enough incentive to get a significant response rate from the control group. For the businesses who did open, they will have a period of 2 weeks to complete the survey, with a reminder email and phone call. After 2 weeks of no-response, they will be emailed and phoned daily to try and generate a response from the restaurant owner. If there is still no response at this point, they will be informed that when the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions are lifted, they will be held back from opening for a significant period of time. Hopefully, this is enough to entice the participant to respond. 

&nbsp;

To ensure participants' privacy, all information from the survey will be collected under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Their responses of the survey will not be shared with anyone, other than the Ontario Government. 

&nbsp;

Since financial compensation is not being offered in this study, the cost will be the amount allotted to Petit Poll in the employment contract. However, it is possible that opening dine-in restaurants will increase the number of COVID-19 cases. This could increase cost for the healthcare profession indirectly.
